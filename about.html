    YouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform
    headquartered in San Bruno, California. It was launched on February 14,
    2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. Owned by Google, it is
    the second most visited website, right after Google itself. YouTube has more
    than one billion monthly users[7] who collectively watch more than one
    billion hours of videos each day.[8] As of May 2019, videos were being
    uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[9][10] In
    October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[11] Google's
    ownership of YouTube has also changed its business model; it no longer
    generates revenue from advertisements alone, YouTube now offers paid content
    such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers a
    paid subscription option for watching content without ads, YouTube Premium.
    YouTube and approved creators participate in Google's AdSense program, which
    seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. YouTube's reported revenue
    for 2020 was $19.8 billion.[12] Since its purchase by Google, YouTube has
    expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and
    the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube
    include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films,
    documentaries, audio recordings, movie trailers, teasers, live streams,
    vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including
    collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media
    corporations such as Disney, Paramount Global, and WarnerMedia have also
    created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a
    larger audience. YouTube has had an unprecedented social impact, influencing
    popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities.
    Despite all its growth and success, YouTube has been widely criticized.
    Criticism of YouTube includes the website being used to facilitate the
    spread of misinformation, copyright issues, routine violations of its users'
    privacy, enabling censorship, and endangering child safety and wellbeing.
