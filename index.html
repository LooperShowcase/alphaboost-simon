      YouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform
      owned by Google. It was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad
      Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is the second most visited website, right
      after Google itself. YouTube has more than one billion monthly users[7]
      who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day.[8]
      As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500
      hours of content per minute.[9][10] In October 2006, YouTube was bought by
      Google for $1.65 billion.[11] Google's ownership of YouTube has also
      changed its business model; it no longer generates revenue from
      advertisements alone, YouTube now offers paid content such as movies and
      exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers a paid subscription
      option for watching content without ads, YouTube Premium. YouTube and
      approved creators participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to
      generate more revenue for both parties. YouTube's reported revenue for
      2020 was $19.8 billion.[12] Since its purchase by Google, YouTube has
      expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and
      the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube
      include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films,
      documentaries, audio recordings, movie trailers, teasers, live streams,
      vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals. This includes
      collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media
      corporations such as Disney, Paramount Global, and WarnerMedia have also
      created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a
      larger audience. YouTube has had an unprecedented social impact,
      influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating
      multimillionaire celebrities. Despite all its growth and success, YouTube
      has been widely criticized. Criticism of YouTube includes the website
      being used to facilitate the spread of misinformation, copyright issues,
      routine violations of its users' privacy, enabling censorship, and
      endangering child safety and wellbeing.
